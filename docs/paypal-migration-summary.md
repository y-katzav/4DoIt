# PayPal Subscriptions Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the payment system from Stripe to **PayPal Subscriptions** to support users in Israel where Stripe is not available. This implementation uses proper recurring billing with automatic renewals.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. PayPal Configuration (`/src/lib/paypal.ts`)
- Created PayPal client configuration for sandbox and production environments
- Defined plan pricing structure (pro, business, enterprise)
- Set up billing intervals (monthly, annual)
- **PayPal Plan IDs mapping** for subscription plans
- Environment-based configuration with fallbacks for development

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

#### `/src/app/api/create-paypal-subscription/route.ts`
- Creates **PayPal subscriptions** (not one-time orders)
- Uses PayPal Plan IDs for recurring billing
- Handles authentication via Firebase tokens
- Stores pending subscription information in Firestore
- Returns PayPal approval URL for subscription confirmation

#### `/src/app/api/capture-paypal-payment/route.ts`
- **Activates PayPal subscriptions** after user approval
- Verifies subscription status with PayPal API
- Updates user subscription status in Firestore
- Calculates subscription end dates based on billing interval
- Handles subscription activation instead of payment capture

#### `/src/app/api/webhooks/paypal/route.ts`
- Processes **PayPal subscription webhook events**:
  - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CREATED`
  - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.ACTIVATED`
  - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.PAYMENT.COMPLETED`
  - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CANCELLED`
  - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.SUSPENDED`
  - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.PAYMENT.FAILED`
- Updates user subscription status automatically
- Handles recurring payment renewals
- Manages subscription lifecycle events

### 3. Frontend Components

#### `/src/components/paypal-checkout-button.tsx`
- Replaces the Stripe checkout button
- Initiates PayPal payment flow
- Redirects users to PayPal for payment
- Handles authentication and error states

#### Updated `/src/components/pricing-table.tsx`
- Migrated from Stripe to PayPal integration
- Uses PayPal pricing and plan structure
- Displays pricing with annual savings calculations

#### Updated `/src/app/profile/page.tsx`
- Added PayPal return URL handling
- Captures payments when users return from PayPal
- Shows payment processing states
- Updated upgrade buttons to use PayPal

### 4. Environment Configuration
Updated `.env.local` with PayPal credentials:
- `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` - PayPal application client ID
- `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` - PayPal application secret
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` - Public client ID for frontend
- `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID` - Webhook endpoint ID
- Plan IDs for each subscription tier and billing interval
